### FAQ
- **Will you provide a flatpak?**

No, Flatpak is a worst way to distribute application, but if you want you can make it

- **Already exist a tool to do it... why make another?**

Simply, first that pre existing tool exist officially only for elementary os, and the tool uses a deprecated functions from GTK, so his existence is in risk

- **Will you add more filters?**

In this tool no, but open an issue with describing filter that i will try create a tool that apply it
